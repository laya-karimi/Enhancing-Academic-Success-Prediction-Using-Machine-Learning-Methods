Our primary code, which yielded the best results, is contained in the 'xgboost_main.ipynb' file. In this file, we employed the XGBoost algorithm, enhanced with GridSearchCV for hyperparameter optimization and data augmentation techniques, specifically oversampling, to improve our outcomes. Additionally, we experimented with other methods, including the random forest algorithm which are also included in this directory. We also explored feature extraction/engineering and the PCA (Principal Component Analysis) method; however, since these did not enhance our results, they are not included in this documentation.
